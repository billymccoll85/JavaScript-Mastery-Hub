region
string|null	Region (formerly GOR). The Region code for each postcode. The nine GORs were abolished on 1 April 2011 and are now known as ‘Regions’. They were the primary statistical subdivisions of England and also the areas in which the Government Offices for the Regions fulfilled their role. Each GOR covered a number of local authorities.
parish

ced
string|null	County Electoral District. The county electoral division code for each English postcode. Pseudo codes are included for the remainder of the UK. The field will be null for English postcodes with no grid reference. English county councils use county electoral divisions (CED) to elect councillors. These CEDs must be confined within district boundaries, but need not be based on whole electoral wards. The only exceptions are the Isles of Scilly and the Greater London Authority (GLA). CEDs do not exist within UAs.

nuts
string|null	International Terratorial Levels (ITL) (Former Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (NUTS). The national LAU1-equivalent code for each postcode. Pseudo codes are included for Channel Islands and Isle of Man. The field will otherwise be blank for postcodes with no grid reference.

As of May 2021. NUTS has changed to International Territorial Levels (ITL). Postcodes.io will report ITL in nuts and codes.nuts to preserve backwards compatibility.

Following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, a new UK-managed international statistical geography - ITL (International Territorial Levels) - was introduced from 1st January 2021, replacing the former NUTS classification. They align with international standards, enabling comparability both over time and internationally. To ensure continued alignment, the ITLs mirror the NUTS system. They also follow a similar review timetable – every three years.

NUTS is a hierarchical classification of spatial units that provides a breakdown of the European Union’s territory for producing regional statistics that are comparable across the Union.

The ITL area classification in the UK comprises current national administrative and electoral areas, except in Scotland where some ITL areas comprise whole and/or part Local Enterprise Regions.

The ONSPD contains the LAU1 code (9-character LAD/UA code for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and 'S30' code for Scotland). A comprehensive lookup of LAU and ITL codes is included with the accompanying metadata.

Methods
The following is a list of available API methods
Postcode Lookup
This uniquely identifies a postcode.

Returns a single postcode entity for a given postcode (case, space insensitive).

If no postcode is found it returns "404" response code.

GEThttps://api.postcodes.io/postcodes/:postcode
Bulk Postcode Lookup
Accepts a JSON object containing an array of postcodes. Returns a list of matching postcodes and respective available data.

Be sure to submit JSON requests setting Content-Type to application/json

Accepts up to 100 postcodes.

POSThttps://api.postcodes.io/postcodes
Post Data
This method requires a JSON object containing an array of postcodes to be posted, e.g.

{
  "postcodes" : ["PR3 0SG", "M45 6GN", "EX165BL"]
}
Optional Query Parameters
filter= (not required) A comma separated whitelist of attributes to be returned in the result object(s), e.g. filter=postcode,longitude,latitude. null responses will continue to return null. If no attributes match the result object, an empty object is returned

Reverse Geocoding
Returns nearest postcodes for a given longitude and latitude.

GEThttps://api.postcodes.io/postcodes?lon=:longitude&lat=:latitude
Optional Query Parameters
limit= (not required) Limits number of postcodes matches to return. Defaults to 10. Needs to be less than 100.

widesearch= (not required) Search up to 20km radius, but subject to a maximum of 10 results. Since lookups over a wide area can be very expensive, we've created this method to allow you choose to make the trade off between search radius and number of results. Defaults to false. When enabled, radius and limits over 10 are ignored.

Additional Response Attributes
distance Distance in metres from specified postode

Legacy
Note that the old style of reverse geocoding (including optional headers above) will still be supported. Namely,

Self Hosting & Local Installations
There may be occasions where you want to host postcodes.io yourself. We've laid out instructions below on how to do this.

We currently provide 4 methods to import the necessary datasets and run the postcodes.io API application:

Docker Installation. Use our Docker application and database images.
Install Script. Clone the repository, install dependencies and npm run setup. This will download the database and import the data from a pg_dump into a locally running instance of PostgreSQL.
Manual Installation via pg_dump. You can download the pg_dump and attempt to import the database yourself with psql or pg_restore.
Manual Installation. Retrieve the raw CSV datasets from Ordnance Survey and ONS; then import it with our import scripts.
1. Docker Installation
Postcodes.io can be installed using two Docker containers: the postcodes.io application container and the postcodes.io database container.

Requirements
Local copy of postcodes.io repository
Docker
Quickstart
If you want to launch the postcodes.io HTTP interface and underlying database quickly, you may do so with docker-compose.

Clone the project repository and run docker-compose:

$ docker-compose up -d
Docker Compose Demo

Running the above command in your terminal will create and network the containers. The HTTP service will be available on port 8000.

Application Container
The Postcodes.io application, which provides the HTTP interface, is packaged as a Docker container identified on the Docker Hub as idealpostcodes/postcodes.io.

Example usage:

$ docker run -d -p 8000 idealpostcodes/postcodes.io
Configuration available via Environment Variables:

POSTGRES_USER
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
POSTGRES_DATABASE
POSTGRES_HOST
POSTGRES_PORT
PORT (HTTP Port to run on)
Database Container
idealpostcodes/postcodes.io.db points to a PostgreSQL & PostGIS base image and preloads the latest pg_dump in the initialisation process.

The database Docker image is updated with new releases of the ONSPD dataset. See the Changelog for when a new dataset has been ingested.

Take Note: Upon starting a container for the first time, PostGIS will be enabled and the pg_dump will take 15-60s to restore depending on your system resources.

Example usage:

$ docker run -p 5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postcodesio -e POSTGRES_DB=postcodesiodb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password idealpostcodes/postcodes.io.db
As this contains the official PostreSQL base image, the available configuration environment variables are documented at: hub.docker.com/_/postgres/

2. Install Script
Requirements
Local copy of postcodes.io repository
Node.js
PostgreSQL and PostGIS
Currently the install process targets Linux and macOS systems. Please let us know if you have issues on those or any other operating systems.

Postcodes.io is packaged with a script to provision PostgreSQL and download a dump of the dataset. The script will:

Prompt you for your PostgreSQL superuser credentials (most of the setup steps require this level of privilege)
Create a new database
Create a new readonly user for the new database
Download, unzip and stream the pg_dump into the new database
To run,

$ npm run setup
3. Manual Installation pg_dump
You can download a pg_dump of the database. This is the same dump used by the install script. The link to the latest dump can be found in our repository.

To setup the database from our pg_dump download, gunzip and use either psql or pg_restore to import the data into PostgreSQL.

For example,

$ cat postcodeiodb.sql | psql postcodesiodb
4. Manual Installation
The install scripts can be linked to your shell (or can be found in the bin/ directory). To link, navigate to postcodes.io/ and run $ npm link
